# Predicting Coral Reef Bleaching with Machine Learning

This project is a part of the Fundamentals of Data Science and Basic Statistics final project requirements. Full documentation and paper can be found at: 

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
Coral reefs hold a significant role and value in the protection of underwater life and coastal areas.  However, coral reefs are facing severe threats that jeopardize their survival as a result of climate change and global warming. This project seeks to study the coral reef bleaching under climate change and predict future occurrences of bleaching with the help of machine learning techniques and modelling.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo.
```bash
pip 
```
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/dataset) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept in the respective dataset folders, [NOAA](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/NOAA_ReefCheck) and [BCO-DMO](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/BCO-DMO).
