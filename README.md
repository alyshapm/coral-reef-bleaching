# Predicting Coral Reef Bleaching with Machine Learning

This project is a part of the Fundamentals of Data Science and Basic Statistics final project requirements. Full documentation and paper can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1egE2OSympimxtCADphQm7I3cNAVWuilPVUM0NNu-enQ/edit).

## Project Intro/Objective
Coral reefs hold a significant role and value in the protection of underwater life and coastal areas.  However, coral reefs are facing severe threats that jeopardize their survival as a result of climate change and global warming. This project seeks to study the coral reef bleaching under climate change and predict future occurrences of bleaching with the help of machine learning techniques and modelling.

## Project Description
Our first step is to validate coral reef bleaching based on the available public data. It will be proceeded by testing supervised learning algorithms  to investigate the effects of different factors on coral reefs and create predictive models. The last step will be to evaluate the plots generated from the algorithm and draw a final conclusion.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo.
```bash
pip 
```
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/dataset) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept in the respective dataset folders, [NOAA](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/NOAA_ReefCheck) and [BCO-DMO](https://github.com/alyshapm/coral-reef-bleaching/tree/main/BCO-DMO).
